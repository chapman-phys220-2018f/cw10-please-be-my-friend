    "Euler's method is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u_{k+1} = u_k + \\Delta t\\, f[t_k, u_k]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this function, $f$ is defined as the slope between individual $u_k$ points where $k \\in N$. This slope, denoted $f_k = \\frac{u_k-u_{k-1}}{t_k-t_{k-1}}$ is taken over the interval $(t_0, t_1,...,t_k)$, where we can more precisely define $u_k = u(t_k)$. Finally, our intitial condition is given as $u_0 = u(t_0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've got all those definitions out of the way, we can now begin to understand what the function does. Essentially, it takes the slope between two points, then multiplies it by the difference in $t$-values. This scalar value is then added to $u_k$ to move it up to the point $u_{k+1}$ which corresponds with a $t_{k+1}$ value. Then, this process is continued for the next point $u_{k+2}$, applying the scalar adjustment to $u_{k+1}$. This process is continued until the end of the interval.\n"

    "\n",
    "$$u_{k+1} = u_{k-1} + 2\\Delta t\\, f[t_k, u_k]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very similar to Euler's method, except for a couple differences. It still takes the slope between $u_k$ points, but this time around it multiples it by twice the difference in $t$ ($2\\Delta t$). Due to this, the adjustment in value is added to $u_{k-1}$ rather than $u_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings up the interesting point of how to calculate $u_1$. If we were to just take $k = 1$, we would be left with a $u_{-1}$ term, which unfortunately doesn't exist. So, we will have to use a different method to calculate this value, as we are given $u_0$ as an initial condition."

    "There are two different steps to this method. The first we have seen before, it is simply Euler's method. However, the second step allows for the method to be accurate to the second order by adding an extra correction. To me at least, this is highly reminisenct of the trapezoid technique for Riemann sums, which I'm going to assume is a good path to follow given the name of this method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyhow, the second step takes the Euler correction and then approximates the midpoint between it and the original point, adding an extra element of accuracy. This scalar is then added to the original $u_k$ value. Process repeats for the entire interval of $t_k$.\n"

    "\n",
    "The two methods diverge in how the slope is taken. For this method, the slope *of the corrected points* is taken, rather than correcting the slopes of the original points. That is, the midpoint of the $t$-values is added to $t_k$ and the approximation $K_1$ is added to $u_k$. Then, the slope is taken This scalar is then finally added to the original $u_k$ value and repeated over the interval."
